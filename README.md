Hi there! My name is Alonso, and I'm a backend developer with experience in building web applications using modern technologies like Express.js, TypeScript, Django, and Python.

I have a passion for developing scalable and efficient backend systems, and I enjoy working with these technologies to create high-quality software.

In my current role as a backend developer, I have used Express.js to build RESTful APIs, TypeScript to add type safety to my code, Django to build full-stack web applications, and Python to develop scripts and automate tasks.

In addition to my technical skills, I am also a strong communicator and a team player. I enjoy collaborating with other developers and working together to find solutions to complex problems.

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, and I am excited to share my work on GitHub. 

Thank you for visiting my profile!
